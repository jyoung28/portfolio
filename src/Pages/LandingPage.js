                Hello all! My name is Jacob Young and I am a Computer Science and Computational Finance
                 and Risk Management double major studying at the University of Washington. Originally 
                 from the Bay Area, I strive to be the most versatile engineer I can, eager to learn new 
                 technologies and quick to apply them. I am currently looking for internship positions 
                 for Summer 2024. In my free time I like swimming, playing water polo, Nintendo games, 
                 reading, camping, hiking and hanging out with friends! Feel free to look around my site 
                 and contact me if you have any questions or interest.
            </p>
